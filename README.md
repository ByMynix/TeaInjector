TeaInjector is an open-source project since 11.09.2021 and no longer closed-source. Please note that there is a file structure and it is not a single, let alone a Visual Studio project. The project is driven by a setup file [Inno Setup Compiler]. Here I will publish the different components of TeaInjector.
